<!-- Or Summery -->

<section id="AM">

<p>Hello! My name is Brandon lum, or people might know me as my online name, Png. I've been working on pservers since October 2016. My main focus is Behaviors and custom content. Like dungeons & event gods etc. I am doing studies on my own for coding in general. I'm leaning toward learning C# & Java. You can find all of my creations on my Youtube channel linked below. I usually put all of my stuff on there and sometimes I'll stream.</p>

<ul>

<li>
   <a href="https://discord.gg/KkneCjW">LoE Realms</a>
     <p>LoE is where it all started for me. Devwarlt ( The owner ) took me in and showed me what to do.
        I started off copy and pasting code untill I learned how things worked. I kept at it and now I'm here!
        I've worked up in ranks on this server. First community moderator. All the way to owner for a few days... Crazy huh? Now I'm one of the few Counselors on the server. Me, Devwarlt, Mike, Miniguy, Arcanuo and Fade. 
     <p/>
 </li>
  
 <li>
   <b>Velocity Realms / Dream Realms</b>
     <p>Once the owner of Velocity handed over ownership of the server me and a friend stepped in and started working on the server. We worked for about 2 weeks to bring out a new, more stable source instead of Realms Reso. We continued to work on it for a while. The owners never really tried to do much so my friends and I quit the server. It died not long after.
